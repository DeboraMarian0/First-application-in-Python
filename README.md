# 🍽️ Restaurant Management System (Python)

This project is a **simple restaurant management system developed in Python**, created as part of a course taken at **Alura**.  
It simulates restaurant registration, listing, and status control through an interactive terminal menu.

📌 **Note:**  
Restaurant data is stored only in memory, meaning **all information is lost once the program is closed**.
